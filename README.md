INTRODUCTION
Project Overview

The Network Traffic Analysis Tool is a comprehensive Python-based application designed to provide real-time network packet capture, analysis, and visualization. The system utilizes modern libraries and
frameworks to create an intuitive graphical interface that allows users to monitor and analyze network traffic patterns effectively.

System Requirements

• Python 3.8 or higher
• Operating System: Windows 10/11, Linux, macOS
• Minimum 4GB RAM
• Network interface card
• Administrative privileges for packet capture

NETWORK ANALYSIS TOOL
1. Core Architecture
1.1 Main Components
• PrateekNetworkAnalyzer: Core class implementing the main application logic and GUI
• PacketFilter: Handles packet filtering based on various criteria
• ProtocolAnalyzer: Manages protocol-specific analysis
• AdvancedVisualizer: Provides advanced visualization capabilities

1.2 Dependencies
• Scapy: Network packet manipulation
• Pandas: Data analysis and manipulation
• Matplotlib: Data visualization
• Tkinter: GUI framework
• Seaborn: Statistical data visualization

2. Detailed Component Analysis

2.1 GUI Implementation (PrateekNetworkAnalyzer)
• Layout: Uses a two-panel design with controls/packet list on the left and visualizations on the
right

Key Features:
• Real-time packet capture display
• Color-coded packet list (TCP: light blue, UDP: light green, ICMP: yellow)
• Statistical summary display
• Interactive control buttons
• Multi-threaded packet capture to maintain UI responsiveness

3. Data Export Capabilities
• JSON export of captured packets
• Excel report generation with summary statistics
• Visualization export as PNG files
• Automated file naming with timestamps

Conclusion
The analyzed network traffic analyzer demonstrates a robust foundation
for network monitoring and analysis. Its modular design allows for easy
extension and modification, while the integration of advanced features
like machine learning and security analysis makes it a valuable tool for
network administrators. The identified areas for improvement provide
clear paths for future development while maintaining the existing
strengths of the application.
